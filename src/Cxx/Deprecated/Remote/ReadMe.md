These two examples have beeen removed as they  both use a deprecated feature, see: [Remove unmaintained remote modules](https://gitlab.kitware.com/vtk/vtk/-/merge_requests/8896)

## Remote Modules

Remote modules are user contributed code that is not distributed with VTK. A description of a remote module and the location of its repository is listed in the VTK/Remote directory with the extension .remote.cmake. Once enabled, a remote module is treated like any other VTK module. Each of the remote module examples describes how to enable the example. More information about remote modules is [here](http://www.vtk.org/Wiki/VTK/Remote_Modules).

| Example Name | Description | Image |
