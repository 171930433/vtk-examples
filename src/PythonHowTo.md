# Python How To

Often you just need a "pointer" to an example that shows you how to do something.

Here are some snippets or examples that highlight interesting features that may help you:

## Read in a Polydata file

| Example Name | Comments | Image |
| -------------- | ---------------------- | ------- |
[ReadPolyData](/Python/Snippets/ReadPolyData.md) | This snippet works for most PolyData.

## Write out an image

| Example Name | Comments | Image |
| -------------- | ---------------------- | ------- |
[WriteImage](/Python/Snippets/WriteImage.md) | Write out an image of various types.

## Random

If you want to ensure that the same random points/colors are used in C++ and other languages then it is best to use vtkMinimalStandardRandomSequence.

| Example Name | Comments | Image |
| -------------- | ---------------------- | ------- |
[HighlightWithSilhouette](/Cxx/Python/HighlightWithSilhouette) | Here we use randomly positioned spheres with random colors. A vtkLookupTable is filled with random colors.
