### Description

Snippets are chunks of code that can be cut (*snipped*) and pasted into examples. We want each example to be stand-alone, so we do not keep the snippet code in a library.

### Available snippets

#### [CameraPosition](/PythonicAPI/Snippets/CameraPosition.md)

Output the camera position while moving the image.

#### [CheckVTKVersion](/PythonicAPI/Snippets/CheckVTKVersion.md)

#### [ReadPolyData](/PythonicAPI/Snippets/ReadPolyData.md)

Uses the appropriate vtkPolyData reader to read any vtkPolyData file.

#### [ScreenShot](/PythonicAPI/Snippets/ScreenshotCallback.md)

Take a screenshot from the render window by pressing a key on the keyboard, the default key is "k". The file extension selects the writer to use.
