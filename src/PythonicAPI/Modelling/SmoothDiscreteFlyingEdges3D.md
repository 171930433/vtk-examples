### Description

Creates surfaces from labeled data. Volume data does not always contain samples of continuous data. A volume may contain discrete integer values, often the result of segmentation. This example smooths the discrete models generated by vtkDiscreteFlyingEdges3D with vtkWindowedSincPolyDataFilter.

An option is provided to use vtkDiscreteMarchingCubes instead of vtkDiscreteFlyingEdges3D.
