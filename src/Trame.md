# Trame Examples

[Trame](https://kitware.github.io/trame/docs/index.html) is a web framework that weaves together open source components into customized visual analytics easily. It uses the VTK and ParaView platforms as its core, **trame** provides complete control of 3D visualizations and data movements.

To familiarize yourself, this [tutorial](https://kitware.github.io/trame/docs/tutorial.html), will teach you

- how to setup virtual environments in Python for **trame**
- how to run an application
- how to build applications.

The example applications here are available as tarballs that you download and open on your computer. Once this is done, you will be able to interact with, and also modify, the application.
